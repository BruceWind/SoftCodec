## Building & Testing

**1. building**

It depend on NDK 16, but you don't need to download manually. 
By the time you executed `./gradlew assembleDebug`, gradle will download it automatically in case 
your computer has no NDK 16.
         
**2. Testing with a RTMP server:**

You may not have a RTMP server.

You need to establish a RTMP server which receives app pushed RTMP stream transmits stream to 
other players.
 
I had written a blog to teach someone else how to establish it.
You can look into the [blog](https://github.com/BruceWind/BruceWind.github.io/blob/master/md/establish-RTMP-server-with-docker.md).

**3. Pushing.**

modify this code in `MainActivity` to target your rtmp server:
``` java 
private String mRtmpPushUrl = "rtmp://192.168.50.14/live/live";
```

 other branches.
